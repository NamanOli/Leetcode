```
Algorithm -

insertionSort(array)
  mark first element as sorted
  for each unsorted element X
    'extract' the element X
    for j <- lastSortedIndex down to 0
      if current element j > X
        move sorted element to the right by 1
    break loop and insert X here
end insertionSort
```

```
Code

// Insertion sort in C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to print an array
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    cout << array[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}

Insertion Sort Applications
The insertion sort is used when:

the array is has a small number of elements
there are only a few elements left to be sorted

void insertionSort(int array[], int size) {
  for (int step = 1; step < size; step++) {
    int key = array[step];
    int j = step - 1;

    // Compare key with each element on the left of it until an element smaller than
    // it is found.
    // For descending order, change key<array[j] to key>array[j].
    while (key < array[j] && j >= 0) {
      array[j + 1] = array[j];
      --j;
    }
    array[j + 1] = key;
  }
}

// Driver code
int main() {
  int data[] = {9, 5, 1, 4, 3};
  int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);
  insertionSort(data, size);
  cout << "Sorted array in ascending order:\n";
  printArray(data, size);
}
```

Time Complexities

Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)

Suppose, an array is in ascending order, and you want to sort it in descending order. In this case, worst case complexity occurs.

Each element has to be compared with each of the other elements so, for every nth element, (n-1) number of comparisons are made.

Thus, the total number of comparisons = n*(n-1) ~ n2

Best Case Complexity: O(n)
When the array is already sorted, the outer loop runs for n number of times whereas the inner loop does not run at all. So, there are only n number of comparisons. Thus, complexity is linear.

Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of an array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

Space Complexity

Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable key is used.
