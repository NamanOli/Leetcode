 Using an externally linked list to store answers.

Approach :

Step 1: Create a new dummy node. It will have the value 0 and will point to NULL respectively. This will be the head of the new list. Another pointer to keep track of traversals in the new list.

Step 2:  Find the smallest among two nodes pointed by the head pointer of both input lists. Store that data in a new list created.

Step 3: Move the head pointer to the next node of the list whose value is stored in the new list.

Step 4: Repeat the above steps till any one of the head pointers stores NULL. Copy remaining nodes of the list whose head is not NULL in the new list.

Time Complexity: O(N+M).

Let N be the number of nodes in list l1 and M be the number of nodes in list l2. We have to iterate through both lists. So, the total time complexity is O(N+M).

Space Complexity: O(N+M).

We are creating another linked list that contains the (N+M) number of nodes in the list. So, space complexity is O(N+M).

2. Optimal 

The idea to do it without extra space is to play around with the next pointers of nodes in the two input lists and arrange them in a fashion such that all nodes are linked in increasing order of values.

Approach :

Step 1: Create two pointers, say l1 and l2. Compare the first node of both lists and find the small among the two. Assign pointer l1 to the smaller value node.

Step 2: Create a pointer, say res, to l1. An iteration is basically iterating through both lists till the value pointed by l1 is less than or equal to the value pointed by l2.

Step 3: Start iteration. Create a variable, say, temp. It will keep track of the last node sorted list in an iteration. 

Step 4: Once an iteration is complete, link node pointed by temp to node pointed by l2. Swap l1 and l2.
l1 always points to smaller node

Step 5: If any one of the pointers among l1 and l2 is NULL, then move the node pointed by temp to the next higher value node.

            if(l1->val < l2->val) {
                res->next = l1; 
                res = res -> next; 
                l1 = l1->next; 
            }
            else {
                res->next = l2; 
                res = res->next; 
                l2 = l2->next; 
            }
        }
        while(l1 != NULL) {
            res->next = l1; 
            res = res -> next;

        // when list2 is empty then our output 
        // will be same as list1
        if(l2 == NULL) return l1;

        // pointing l1 and l2 to smallest and greatest one
        if(l1->val > l2->val) std::swap(l1,l2);

        // act as head of resultant merged list
        ListNode* res = l1;

        while(l1 != NULL && l2 != NULL) {
 
            ListNode* temp = NULL;

            while(l1 != NULL && l1->val <= l2->val) {

                temp = l1;//storing last sorted node  
                l1 = l1->next;
            }

            // link previous sorted node with 
            // next larger node in list2
            temp->next = l2;
            std::swap(l1,l2);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

Time Complexity :

We are still traversing both lists entirely in the worst-case scenario. So, it remains the same as O(N+M) where N is the number of nodes in list 1 and M is the number of nodes in list 2.

Space Complexity :

We are using the same lists just changing links to create our desired list. So no extra space is used. Hence, its space complexity is O(1).
