https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

1. Brute 

- Traverse any one linked list and at every element check whether its the same node. Dont check for same value as we have to check whether it is the same node.

Time Complexity - O(N * M)

2. Optimal 

- Using Hashing

- Store address of one of the linked list in the hash table
- Iterate the 2nd linked list and search for the address of the 2nd linked list in the hash table
- if any address matches then it means its intersecting 


Time Complexity - O(N + M) -  for traversing both the linked list
Space Complexity - O(size of the first linked list)

3. Best Optimal Approach

- Use dummy variables to calculate length of each of the linked list
- Find the difference of each linked list length as d
- increment the longer linked list by d steps 
- after that increment both linked list by one and if they merges then there exists intersection


Time Complexity - O(2M) -  for traversing both the linked list
Space Complexity - O(1)

4. Best Optimal Approach 1

- Use dummy pointers for each linked and traverse each linked list together
- once a linked list arises at the end ,point it to the head of other linked list
- if a & b have different len, then we will stop the loop after second iteration
- After each iteration stop if lengths are different

 *     int val;

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        if(headA==NULL||headB==NULL)
        {
            return NULL;
        }
        ListNode *a=headA;
        ListNode *b=headB;
         //if a & b have different len, then we will stop the loop after second iteration
        while(a!=b) // until they are either both NULL or they are equal
        {
            //for the end of first iteration, we just reset the pointer to the head of another linkedlist
            a=a==NULL ? headB:a->next; // if they reach end point it to head of other linked list 
            b=b==NULL ? headA:b->next; 
        }
        return a; // return either of the pointer as they will point to same position
    }
};
```
