Heap Sort Applications
Systems concerned with security and embedded systems such as Linux Kernel use Heap Sort because of the O(n log n) upper bound on Heapsort's running time and constant O(1) upper bound on its auxiliary storage.
Although Heap Sort has O(n log n) time complexity even for the worst case, it doesn't have more applications ( compared to other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort ). However, its underlying data structure, heap, can be efficiently used if we want to extract the smallest (or largest) from the list of items without the overhead of keeping the remaining items in the sorted order. For e.g Priority Queues


```
// Heap Sort in C++
  
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  
  void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
    // Find largest among root, left child and right child
    int largest = i;
    int left = 2 * i + 1;
    int right = 2 * i + 2;
  
    if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
      largest = left;
  
    if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
      largest = right;
  
    // Swap and continue heapifying if root is not largest
    if (largest != i) {
      swap(arr[i], arr[largest]);
      heapify(arr, n, largest);
    }
  }
  
  // main function to do heap sort
  void heapSort(int arr[], int n) {
    // Build max heap
    for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
      heapify(arr, n, i);
  
    // Heap sort
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      swap(arr[0], arr[i]);
  
      // Heapify root element to get highest element at root again
      heapify(arr, i, 0);
    }
  }
  
  // Print an array
  void printArray(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
      cout << arr[i] << " ";
    cout << "\n";
  }
  
  // Driver code
  int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 12, 9, 5, 6, 10};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    heapSort(arr, n);
  
    cout << "Sorted array is \n";
    printArray(arr, n);
  }
  ```
